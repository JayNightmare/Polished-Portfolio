### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The built files will be in the `dist` directory
# Deploy the contents of `dist` to your hosting provider
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Radix UI Imports
The Radix imports in the component files originally contained pinned version suffixes (e.g. `@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2`). Standard module resolution expects package names without the `@version` suffix. Update them if build errors occur by removing the suffix.

### Environment Setup
Make sure to configure your environment variables properly for GitHub integration and contact form functionality to work correctly.
